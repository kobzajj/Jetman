An endless runner game written entirely in x86 assembly language

This game was written and build using the MASM 32 compiler for x86 Assembly. It can only be run on windows machines.
In order to install and run the project, you must first install the MASM 32 compiler. It can be found here:

Once it has been installed, you can build the project by going to the correct directory on the windows command prompt and typing the command "make". Once this has been done, the game can be run in full screen mode by typing the name of the file directory, or in windowed mode by typing the name of the directory followed by "win" (in the same word).
